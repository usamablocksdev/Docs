Farming is a great way to earn LOOP rewards on LOOPSwap.

## Getting prepared <a id="getting-prepared"></a>

Farming takes a little work to get set up.

You’re going to need some "LP Tokens" to enter into a Farm with. Farms can only accept their own exact LP Token. for example, the LOOP-ONE Farm will only accept LOOP-ONE LP Tokens.

To get the exact LP Token, you'll need to provide liquidity for that trading pair. So to get LOOP-ONE LP Tokens, you'll first have to provide liquidity for the LOOP-ONE pair.

It may sound intimidating, but it's not too complicated. Let's go through step by step.

### Finding your Farm <a id="finding-your-farm"></a>

Before you proceed, you'll want to choose a Farm that's right for you. [Visit the Farms page](https://tequila-graph.loop.markets/farm#stake) and you’ll see a list of available Farms.

When you find a Farm that you'd like to use, note down the trading pair, e.g. LOOP-LUNA in case you need it later.
