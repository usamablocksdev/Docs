**1. What are Mirror synthetic assets?**

The aim of mAssets is to mimic the price trends of real-world exchange-traded underlying assets and give investors access to not only home markets but also foreign markets as well. While mAAPL tries to closely represent the movements of AAPL stock, users are not afforded any rights of the underlying asset and tracking errors may arise due to the imbalances in trading volume in the underlying markets and the Terraswap markets.
